# Project Battleship

This project is a Battleship game implemented using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The main objectives of this project were:

1. Create an interactive and visually appealing Battleship game interface.
2. Learn and implement the HTML Drag and Drop API for ship placement.
3. Write unit tests for the game logic using Jest.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to create the game's structure and layout.
- CSS: Utilized for styling the game interface and making it visually appealing.
-- Vanilla JavaScript: Implemented the game logic, including ship placement, firing, and win conditions.
- HTML Drag and Drop API: Employed for drag-and-drop ship placement functionality.
- Jest: Used for unit testing the game's logic to ensure it works correctly.

## Game Rules
The Battleship game follows the classic rules:

- The game board consists of a 10x10 grid.
- Each player (you and the computer) has a fleet of ships to place on the grid.
- Ships include:
  - Aircraft Carrier (5 cells)
  - Battleship (4 cells)
  - Cruiser (3 cells)
  - Submarine (3 cells)
  - Destroyer (2 cells)
- Players take turns guessing the coordinates to fire at each other's ships.
- The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game.
